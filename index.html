    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>
      I was introduced to programming in two ways: <br />
      <!-- List example -->
      <ol>
        <li>Learning QBASIC in High-School (yep, they still taught that)</li>
        <li>Massive C++ textbook after asking a cousin who worked in the industry about programming</li>
      </ol>

      <!-- Text formatting examples-->
      Needless to say, I never touched it again until after graduating from CUNY Hunter College with a BA in Creative Writing. <br>

      I went to college while working in <strong>New York Public Library</strong>, first as a <em>Page</em> and then a <em>Library Technical Assistant</em>. After graduating, I decided to look into tech again since I heard buzz about interesting career opportunities. I was pleasantly surprised when I started learning to program using Ruby. My creative side did not feel supressed as it had when I tried programming in the past. <br> <br>
      In fact, bringing my creative side to the machine felt downright delightful. So, I decided to become a programmer!
      <br> <br>

      I <em>love</em> programming using the <strong>Ruby</strong> language. I am using <em><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong></em> primarily for building things on the web. After familiarizing myself with <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>, I've started learning more front-end technologies such vanilla <strong>Javascript</strong> along with <strong>React</strong>. <br> <br>
