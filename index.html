          I was introduced to programming in the following two ways: <br />
          <!-- List example -->
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Learning QBASIC in High-School (yep, they still taught that)</li>
          <li>
            Massive C++ textbook after asking a cousin who worked in the
            industry about programming
          </li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Text formatting examples-->
        Needless to say, I never touched it again until after graduating from
        CUNY Hunter College with a BA in Creative Writing. <br />

        I went to college while working in
        <strong>New York Public Library</strong>, first as a <em>Page</em> and
        then a <em>Library Technical Assistant</em>. After graduating, I decided
        to look into tech again since I heard buzz about interesting career
        opportunities. I was pleasantly surprised when I started learning to
        program using Ruby. My creative side did not feel supressed as it had
        when I tried programming in the past. <br />
        <br />
        In fact, bringing my creative side to the machine felt downright
        delightful. So, I decided to become a programmer!
        <br />
        <br />

        I <em>love</em> programming using the <strong>Ruby</strong> language. I
        am using <em><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong></em> primarily for building
        things on the web. After familiarizing myself with
        <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>, I've started learning more front-end
        technologies such vanilla <strong>Javascript</strong> along with
        <strong>React</strong>. <br />
